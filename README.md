## Goal :

Design and implement a digital clock using NeoPixel displays. The clock will display the current time, support alarms, and synchronize with network time servers (NTP) to ensure accurate timekeeping. Set up physical buttons or touch/proximity input to interact with the clock (e.g., set time, set alarms, snooze alarms). Implement basic functions to control the NeoPixel LEDs (e.g., setting color, brightness, and individual pixel control).
